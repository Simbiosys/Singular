This tutorial is made width Middleman, https://middlemanapp.com/

While developing you can start the process with:

  middleman server

This starts a live web server that watches any change and recompiles the project.
Stylesheets use SASS.

To build the production tutorial:

  middleman build

This creates a static copy in the build folder.
